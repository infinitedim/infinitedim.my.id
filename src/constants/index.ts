  "Hello, I'm Dimas Saputra, I'm a ReactionJS specialised frontend developer based in Bekasi, Indonesia.I am now a software developer at PT Voltras International, a little story of how i got to know programming, at that time i was in grade 10 high school and i was told about html by my teacher, and i started learning htmlcss and a little javascript and php, a few weeks later my teacher was interested in taking me to a competition called ITNSA Web Technology, it was a district level competition, at that time the competition required to use Laravel, while i had only studied php for 2 weeks, as a result i did not win but i was happy to be able to add new knowledge. After that I also started learning self-taught until grade 12, when I was learning I experienced many difficulties like unqualified devices and slow internet networks, I think that's all I can say thank you." as const;
